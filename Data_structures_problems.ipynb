Code can contain any brackets from the set []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and the closing brackets corresponding to them are ],}, and ).\n",
        "For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that there is an error in the usage of brackets, but also point to the exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesn’t have an opening bracket before it, like ] in ](), or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing bracket after it, like ( in {}([]. If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of brackets is correct.\n",
        "Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks.\n",
        "More formally, all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of matching brackets, such that in each pair the opening bracket goes before the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either one of them is nested inside another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in f(a,b)-g[c]. The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to }, and ( corresponds to ).\n",

They are also used in data analysis and machine learning both for hierarchi- cal clustering and building complex predictive models, including some of the best-performing in practice algorithms like Gradient Boosting over Decision Trees and Random Forests. In the later modules of this course, we will introduce balanced binary search trees (BST) — a special kind of trees that allows to very efficiently store, manipulate and retrieve data. Balanced BSTs are thus used in databases for efficient storage and actually in virtually any non-trivial programs, typically via built-in data structures of the programming language at hand.\n",

Now you need to test whether the given binary tree is indeed a correct binary search tree. In other words, you want to ensure that you can search for integers in this binary tree using binary search through the tree, and you will always get correct result: if the integer is in the tree, you will find it, otherwise you will not.\n",

The definition of the binary search tree is the following: for any node of the tree, if its key is 𝑥, then for any node in its left subtree its key must be strictly less than 𝑥, and for any node in its right subtree its key must be strictly greater than 𝑥. In other words, smaller elements are to the left, and bigger elements are to the right. You need to check whether the given binary tree structure satisfies this condition. You are guaranteed that the input contains a valid binary tree. That is, it is a tree, and each node has at most two children.\n",
